#HOWEVER we encourage to run it locally as on deployed website database permissions are with us and you will not be able to see database.
#steps to run locally:
#first run donordb.py in command line and see that the database is created
#then run app.py in command shell
#fill the donation form and see updated database and email sent to your address.
